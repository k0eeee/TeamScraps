## Team Introduction:

Hello! We're a versatile group and our goal for this project is to develop Snake Game.


TEAM ROLES:

Leader: Chloe Vegiga (screen/UI)

Sub-leader: Ashley Lee (sound and animation)

Developer
1. Melih Emir (input & event)
2. Ahmad Najmi (core and github manager)
3. Emmitt Aguirre (snake development)
4. Damisola Talabi (score & file manager)
5. Muhammad Haziq (environment & collision)


## Team Requirements: 

The overall project requirements that we're responsible for include redesigning the game to include two ships and make it more challenging for the players to work together. We'd handle the two input settings to work at the same time without conflicting with one another, and manage the collision between the two players when onscreen at the same time.


## Detailed Requirements: 
- Handle input and coordinate controls so that both players may use the same keyboard at the same time
- Manage the way the two ships will interact when onscreen and whether they'll conflict with each other (friendly fire?)
- Increase the speed of game mode to have the players work as a team against mobs
- The creation of two spaceships and have them separately co-exist on the same screen and be able to distinguish from each other    
- Decide between two health bars/one big health bar - co-op vs versus?

## Dependencies on Other Teams:
